Where do you go to find help on javascript questions? Letâ€™s say you want to find information on how promises work in ES6. What does that mean? Make a list of at least 3 resources you consulted in finding that answer.
I usually google a questions and click on a number of links until I find an easy to understand tutorial or blog explaining my question. I often end up on stack overflow.
A promise represents the eventual result of some operation or request. They have "pending" states, which can be changed to "fulfilled" or "resolved." You can also reject them.
