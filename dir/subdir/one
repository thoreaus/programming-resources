What is a backend server? What are 3 good resources for understanding servers? What do you specifically like about those resources?
The backend is what is necessary for a site to be dynamic and constantly changing. It is not seen or accessible to users who visit the site, but this is where saved data, passwords, and usernames lie.

I like youtube videos for explaining concepts because of the moving pictures and how a video is lecture-like. Also videos make me work less (not having to read) when learning something new :)
The codeup explanation was helpful and I liked how short and sweet it was (2 paragraphs instead of 10 paragraphs of extra, unneccessary info).
